# NNM-FearConditioning
This repository contains a Matlab script simulating the neural network model built and tested in "An Anatomically Constrained Neural Network Model of Fear Conditioning" (Armony, Cohen, Servan-Schreiber & LeDoux, 1995). 

The model implements (1) nonlinear computational unit with lateral inhibition (2) the dual-pathway and (3) Stent-Hebb learning, making the model more neuroanatomically constrained.

**SX_v1**
- trains the model with different hyperparameter settings
- records activation changes over multiple runs and epochs
- visualizes the receptive of each unit in each layer (activation as a function of frequencies in arbitrary units)

**plot_RampFxn**
- visualizes the relation between the input and output of the ramp function
